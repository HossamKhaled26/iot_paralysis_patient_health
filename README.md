# iot_paralysis_patient_health
The IoT-based healthcare system for paralysis patients enables communication between patients and their doctors, nurses, or loved ones via the internet. The system uses a microcontroller with a hand motion recognition circuit that detects hand movements through an accelerometer and gyroscope. These movements are transmitted wirelessly to a receiver, which processes the commands and displays them on an LCD screen, while also sending the data to the IoT Gecko server for online access. This setup helps patients convey messages efficiently, improving their ability to communicate despite mobility limitations.
